# JLTUseCase
## Case Study: 
The risk manager from a consultancy wants to analyse  Workers Compensation risk in the United States. He has hired you as a consultant to identify the key factors of high cost  workers compensation claim across the US. He provides historical loss experience data.

### Background
Workers Compnesation policy is mandatory for most of the companies in US for the benefit of employees. The experience of claims in workers compnesation drives the premium for next years renewal. Hence each company would like to understand the key reasons/ factors for the high cost claims. 

### Objective 1
Explore the claims experience (using graphs/plots), Build a model to predict high cost workers compnesation claim and highlight the key drivers of high cost claims. 

#### Challenge
Risk manager from his primary analysis has identified that if a case has enterd into litigation, this will drive the cost of claims. The challenge here is when a claimant files his claim neither the insurer nor the employer is aware if a case will go for litigation. Hence primary objective becomes to predict whether a claim will go for litigation or not.

### Objective 2
Prove that litigation is the key driver of high cost claims using statistical analysis and tests. Predict if the case will go for litigation. Hence drive the objective 1.

### Objective 3
Use NLP techniques to engineer features from description (stated in hint below).

#### Hint
Engineer features from description such as cause of injury, body parts damaged and any which helps predict the  Litigation cases/high cost claims. Also you are free to engineer new features with relevant logic behind them

### Domain Knowledge
**Carrier:**	Insurance Carrier

**Loss Type:**	Type of Claim

**Litigation:**	Attorney or legal involvement

**High Cost	Claim:** Cost above $20,000 marked as high cost
	
	
**Note**	Assumptions should be stated clear when used in modeling. Try to handle missing information as much as possible.
	Preferred programmig language of analysis Python
